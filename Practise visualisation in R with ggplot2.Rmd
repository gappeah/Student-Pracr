```{r}
data <- read.csv('../DATA/cdc.csv')
print(data)
```

# Exercise 1: Prepare the data
## Read the data from file cdc.csv. Review the data types. For categorical binary variables, change 0-1 to “no”-“yes”.
## Split the data set into data for males and data for females.


```{r}
#For the smokers
data$smoke100 <- ifelse(data$smoke100 == 1, "yes", "no")

#For the exerany
data$exerany <- ifelse(data$exerany == 1, "yes", "no")


#For the hlthplan
data$hlthplan <- ifelse(data$hlthplan == 1, "yes", "no")


head(data[, c("smoke100", "exerany", "hlthplan")])

head(data)

```

```{r}
males <- data[data$gender == 'm',]

```

```{r}
print(males)
```

```{r}
females <- data[data$gender == 'f',]
```
```{r}
print(females)
```

#🧪 Exercise 2: Scatterplots
## 1. Create a scatterplot for male heights and weights.
## 2. On the same scatterplot, use different colours to represent the general state of health of the individuals.
##3. On the same scatterplot, represent smokers and non-smokers by different shape points.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)

males <- data[data$gender == 'm',]

# Create scatterplot
ggplot(data = males, aes(x = weight, y = height)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(
    title = "Male Height vs Weight",
    x = "Weight (lbs)",
    y = "Height (inches)",
  )

```


```{r}
ggplot(data = males, aes(x = weight, y = height, color = genhlth)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Male Height vs Weight by General Health")

```

```{r}

# Create scatterplot
ggplot(data = males, aes(x = weight, y = height, color = genhlth, shape = smoke100)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(
    title = "Male Height vs Weight",
    x = "Weight (lbs)",
    y = "Height (inches)",
    color = "General Health",
    shape = "Smoker Status"
  )

```



# Exercise 3: Working with categorical variables - facets
## 2. Create a scatterplot for heights and weights for people of each state (level) of general health and each gender.


# Exercise 3: Working with categorical variables – facets
##1. Create a scatterplot for male heights and weights for people of each state (level) of general health.

```{r}
ggplot(data = males, aes(x = weight, y = height)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap(~ genhlth) +
  labs(title = "Male Height vs Weight by General Health")

```
#2. Create a scatterplot for heights and weights for people of each state of general health and each gender.
```{r}
ggplot(data = males, aes(x = weight, y = height)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap(~ genhlth + gender) +
  labs(title = "Male Height vs Weight by General Health by Gender")
```

#🧪 Exercise 4: Line plots
## 1. Create a line plot for male heights and weights.
```{r}
data_male_ordered <- males[order(data$weight), ]

ggplot(data_male_ordered, aes(x = weight, y = height)) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(title = "Line Plot: Male Height vs Weight")

```


# 2. Create line plots for male heights and weights and female heights and weights on the same coordinate system.

```{r}
females <- data[data$gender == 'f',]

males <- data[data$gender == 'm',]

data_male_ordered <- males[order(data$weight), ]
data_female_ordered <- females[order(data$weight), ]


data_female_ordered$group <- "f"
data_male_ordered$group <- "m"

data_combined <- rbind(data_male_ordered, data_female_ordered)

ggplot(data_combined, aes(x = weight, y = height, color = group)) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(title = "Line Plot: Height vs Weight by Gender")

```


#Exercise 5: Bar plots
##1. Create a bar plot showing the number of people of each state (level) of general health (both men and women).



```{r}
ggplot(data, aes(x = genhlth)) +
  geom_bar(fill = "steelblue") +
  labs(title = "Count of People by General Health")

```

#2. Create a bar plot showing the number of people of each state of general health as a percentage split between men and women.
```{r}
ggplot(data, aes(x = genhlth, fill = gender)) +
  geom_bar(position = "fill") +  # fill gives proportions
  labs(title = "Proportion of General Health by Gender", y = "Proportion") +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent)

```
